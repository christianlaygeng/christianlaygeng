- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @christianlaygeng, recent graduate from UCSD.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in human-centered design because I love it's ability to understand users and create optimal designs. I also delve into VR on the side.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently aiming to be a UX Designer. I have both theoretical and practical experience designing web and app designs, and am currently a part of Design Buddies to learn more about industry standards.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at claygeng@ucsd.edu or at (619)-453-1202. Please check out my portfolio at https://claygeng.squarespace.com/ for an in-depth analysis of my projects.
